## Getting Started / Code Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

* **Backend:** `git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/ghada001/care-nest-backend.git`

### 2. Backend Setup:


- `cd care-nest-backend`
- Create a Python Virtual Environment `pipenv shell`
- Install required dependancies:
    - `pipenv install django`
    - `pipenv install django djangorestframework psycopg2-binary`
- Migrations:
    - `python manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python manage.py migrate`
- Create a suoeruser, and run server:
    - `python manage.py createsuperuser` , to simplify type: `admin` => `admin@email.com` => `admin` => `y `
- To run the server:
    - `python manage.py runserver`


## Implementation Notes

* During the development process, I decided to **drop the `Post` model** due to time constraints.

* For user roles:

  * I initially planned to create separate `Parent` and `Supervisor` models using Django custom user models.
  * After researching and attempting to follow a tutorial, I faced complexity and frontend integration issues.
  * To simplify, I assigned **Supervisors** as Django `superusers`, and **Parents** are represented using the default built-in `User` model.

* The **exit code (OTP)** feature was also removed from the final version to meet project deadlines.

## IceBox Features

1. Implementing a customized user type
2. Add staff (employees that the supervisor can track too)
3. Add the `Post` model for communication between daycare and parents
4. Add the OTP code "Exit Code"
5. Add subscriptions and offers
6. Add food preferences for each child
7. Better UI/UX
8. Profile page for users
9. Parents can't Signup, because in real world, parent went first to the daycare, register their data there, and give them their acccounts. but I created the Sign up because its required to have a Signup page.
10. Add a summary content in the home component for each user.
